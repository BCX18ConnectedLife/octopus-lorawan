# Octopus LoRa FeatherWing Example
An example Arduino sketch to demonstrate how to use the Octopus board in 
combination with an Adafruit LoRa Radio FeatherWing to communicate in a
LoRaWAN.

This example is based on work of Thomas Telkamp and Matthijs Kooijman which
can be found here: https://github.com/matthijskooijman/arduino-lmic/blob/master/examples/ttn-otaa/ttn-otaa.ino

## Arduino IDE Setup
Follow the instructions given here:
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/using-arduino-ide

When finished, you should be able to get the "Blink Test" sketch running successfully.
